01_CUDA-Background
===================

Introduction
-------------
This is the initial introduction to learn CUDA. I used a lot of references to learn the basics about CUDA, all of them are included in the file **00_References.pdf**. 
There is a pdf file that contains the basic theory to start programming in CUDA, as well as a source code to practice the theory explained and its solution.

-------------

List of files
-------------
> * **00_References.pdf** list of references used for the presentation.
> * **01_Background.pdf** theory to solve the practice.
> * **Source_code/00add_P.cu** script for practice.
> * **Source_code/00add_S.cu** solution of the practice.

**NOTE**: The **_P** and the **_S** in the scripts' name mean *practice* and *solution* respectively. Try to complete the practice and compare it with the solution at the end.

-------------

Running the scripts
-------------

**NOTE**: All the codes have been tested in linux environments. The command **nvcc** is used to compile CUDA source files, it is similar to the command **gcc** used to compile *C* source codes.

```
// The '$' indicates the prompt in the command window in linux.

//1. Compile. The flag '-o' is used to create a execution file with the name "exe", the name can be changed. 
$ nvcc 00add_S.cu -o exe

//2. Execute. './' is used to execute the program in the current directory.
$./exe  

//3. Result.
-: successful execution :-
```
