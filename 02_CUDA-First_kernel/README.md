02_CUDA-First_kernel
===================

Introduction
-------------
This is an introduction to learn CUDA. I used a lot of references to learn the basics about CUDA, all of them are included in the file **00_References.pdf**. 
There is a pdf file that contains the basic theory to start programming in CUDA, as well as a source code to practice the theory explained and its solution.

List of files
-------------
> * **00_References.pdf** list of references used for the presentation.
> * **02_First kernel.pdf** theory to solve the practice.
> * **Source_code/01simple_kernel/01simple_kernel.cu**  example.
> * **Source_code/01simple_kernel/makefile**  to compile and to execute.
> * **Source_code/02simple_kernel2/01simple_kernel2.cu**  example.
> * **Source_code/02simple_kernel/makefile**  to compile and to execute..

Running the scripts
-------------

**NOTE**: All the codes have been tested in linux environments. A makefile is used to generate the execution file, you can see the makefile's description here [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) and here [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction).

```
// The '$' indicates the prompt in the command window in linux.

//1. Compile. 
$ make

//2. Execute. 
$make run

//3. Result.
./exe
Hello, World!
```
